Hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup

This section will expand the concept of hashing as follow:
1. Hash Table (without conflict and fixed size)
2. Hash Table (with conflict)
	a. Direct Addressing
	b. Linear Probing
	c. Etc. 

Direct Addressing is the techinique to store key into table

Chaining is the techiniques that store hash table as an array of linked list

Linear Probing is the techiniques that tries to find a free space to store when the table is full (What is the table already reach its capicity already?)
