	-- |---------|------|
	-- | 1       | 1    |
	-- | 2       | 0    |

	-- | 4       |

# SOLUTION
# UNION
select c1.seat_id from cinema c1, cinema c2 where c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id - 1 and c1.free = c2.free and c1.free = 1
union
select c1.seat_id from cinema c1, cinema c2 where c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id + 1 and c1.free = c2.free and c1.free = 1


# WITHOUT UNION (more efficient)
select distinct c1.seat_id
from cinema c1, cinema c2
where c1.free = c2.free and c1.free = 1 and (c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id - 1 or c1.seat_id = c2.seat_id + 1)
